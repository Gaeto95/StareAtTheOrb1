# Stare at the Orb

An immersive cosmic experience that combines AI-generated wisdom with ethereal visuals and voice synthesis. Users are invited to stare into a mystical orb that speaks profound cosmic nonsense through OpenAI's GPT and ElevenLabs' voice synthesis.

## 🌌 Experience

**Stare at the Orb** creates a meditative, otherworldly experience where:

- A cosmic orb pulses with ethereal energy against a dynamic starfield backdrop
- The orb can generate and speak mystical wisdom using AI (limited to preserve API costs)
- Intensity levels increase every 15 seconds, creating progressively more spectacular visual effects
- After 66 seconds of inactivity, a congratulatory "time wasting" message appears
- After 150 seconds of continuous staring, achieve the ultimate "Master Procrastinator" status
- All interactions are comprehensively tracked for analytics across multiple sites

## 📈 Analytics Dashboard

Comprehensive analytics are available through Supabase including:

### Available Metrics:

- **Staring Time**: How long users actively stare at the orb
- **Intensity Progression**: Which levels users reach and how quickly
- **Interaction Patterns**: Orb clicks, mute toggles, wild mode triggers
- **Voice Generation Stats**: Success rates, error tracking, API usage
- **Achievement Tracking**: Ultimate level completions and congratulatory messages
- **Performance Data**: Load times, API response times, error rates

### Sample Analytics Queries:

```sql
-- Average session duration
SELECT AVG(CAST(event_data->>'duration' AS INTEGER)) as avg_session_ms
FROM site_events 
WHERE event_name = 'session_end' AND site_name = 'stare-at-the-orb';

-- Intensity level distribution
SELECT 
  event_data->>'intensity_level' as level,
  COUNT(*) as activations
FROM site_events 
WHERE event_name = 'wild_mode_activated' 
GROUP BY event_data->>'intensity_level'
ORDER BY level;

-- Ultimate achievement rate
SELECT 
  COUNT(CASE WHEN event_name = 'ultimate_ascension_achieved' THEN 1 END) as ultimate_achieved,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN event_name = 'session_start' THEN 1 END) as total_sessions,
  ROUND(
    COUNT(CASE WHEN event_name = 'ultimate_ascension_achieved' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / 
    NULLIF(COUNT(CASE WHEN event_name = 'session_start' THEN 1 END), 0), 
    2
  ) as achievement_rate_percent
FROM site_events;

-- Daily active sessions
SELECT 
  DATE(created_at) as date,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_agent) as unique_sessions
FROM site_events 
WHERE event_name = 'session_start'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;

-- Voice generation success rate
SELECT 
  COUNT(CASE WHEN event_name = 'voice_played' THEN 1 END) as successful,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN event_name = 'voice_error' THEN 1 END) as failed,
  ROUND(
    COUNT(CASE WHEN event_name = 'voice_played' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / 
    NULLIF(COUNT(CASE WHEN event_name IN ('voice_played', 'voice_error') THEN 1 END), 0), 
    2
  ) as success_rate_percent
FROM site_events;
```
