## 📈 Analytics & Data Insights

The application includes a comprehensive analytics system that tracks user engagement patterns:

### Tracked Metrics
- **Session Duration**: Average time spent on site
- **Intensity Progression**: How far users advance through the 10 levels
- **Interaction Patterns**: Click rates, mute toggles, achievement unlocks
- **API Usage**: Success rates, error tracking, cost monitoring
- **Performance Data**: Load times, rendering performance, error rates

### Sample Analytics Queries

```sql
-- User engagement analysis
SELECT 
  AVG(CAST(event_data->>'duration' AS INTEGER)) / 1000 as avg_session_seconds,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_agent) as unique_sessions,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN event_name = 'ultimate_ascension_achieved' THEN 1 END) as ultimate_completions
FROM site_events 
WHERE site_name = 'stare-at-the-orb';

-- Intensity level distribution
SELECT 
  event_data->>'intensity_level' as level,
  COUNT(*) as activations,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 2) as percentage
FROM site_events 
WHERE event_name = 'wild_mode_activated' 
GROUP BY event_data->>'intensity_level'
ORDER BY level;

-- API cost monitoring
SELECT 
  DATE(created_at) as date,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN event_name = 'voice_played' THEN 1 END) as successful_speeches,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN event_name = 'voice_error' THEN 1 END) as failed_speeches,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN event_name = 'ai_message_generated' THEN 1 END) as ai_generations
FROM site_events 
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```
